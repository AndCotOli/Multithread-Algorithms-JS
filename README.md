# Multithread Algorithms in Javascript

Some of the most popular algorithms, written using multithread Javascript!

This project was highly inspired by [Javascript Algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) by [Oleskii Trekhleb](https://github.com/trekhleb)

## Usage
Use `node index.js <Number_of_Cores>` inside the algorithm folder.
> Note: If you don't specify a number of cores to be used, it will default to all of them.

When the process has finished, it will create a text file with the result
